# FarmGame

FarmGame is a game about growing a farm and making a profit. 

This is a project I vibed up to get some exposure to working with a .NET Maui codebase.
Really good way to learn, really bad program.

The game itself is missing a boatload of features and riddled with bugs that I may or may not get around to fixing.
It should at least compile and run in visual studio.
